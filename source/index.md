> HUGEFANCY is a Project exploring large scale additive manufacturing. It was built as a graduation project at the faculty of Industrial Design [BURG-Halle](https://www.burg-halle.de)  by [Chris Walter](https://www.chriswalter.org)  and [Robin Godwyll](https://github.com/robin-gdwl). 

This Page includes all the technical documentation for the actual printer, its firmware and electronics as well as custom Print algorithms we created during the Project.
